*Take notes, and use tags and hyperlinking to form relationships between your notes
*Use tags, tabs, tables, lists, or a table of contents to get organzed
*Bookmark your favorite websites
*Keep track of tasks and appointments, and organize them by multiple tags (see TaskManagementExample)
*Inventory just about anything: your recipes, personal library, contacts, music collection, and more
*Create a blog or website
*Write a book
*Organize your images into galleries (see [[ImageGallery Example]])
*Share the information in your ~TiddlyWiki with others, as an online file, as a file attachment, as a tiddler file, or as a link to a specific online tiddler (try clicking and dragging a tiddler from one ~TiddlyWiki file to another to see what happens)
*Draw a sketch (Edit [[Motovun Jack.jpg]] and start drawing over the image to see what happens)
*Create a modal wizard (also known as a lightbox) - see SampleWizard
*Create a slideshow presentation
*Set up an entire local or online knowledgebase, with a central ~TiddlyWiki file linking to other ~TiddlyWiki files (http://recursos.giffmex.org is a Spanish online example of this)
*Set up a data visualization using tiddlers as data (see the visualizations at http://tiddlywiki.com/d3demo.html)
*Create a timeline (See http://emkayonline.github.io/tw5visjs/#ShowTimelineDemo)
